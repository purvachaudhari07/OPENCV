#  Virtual Paint Project

This project allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using real-world colored objects detected by a webcam. Built using Python and OpenCV, it tracks the position of colored markers (like a blue or green pen cap) and maps the movement to on-screen drawing.

##  Features
- Real-time color detection using HSV ranges
- Draw with multiple colors (blue, green, pink, etc.)
- Clear the canvas using a key command
- Smooth drawing using contour tracking

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

##  Concepts Practiced
- Webcam integration
- HSV color space
- Masking and contour detection
- Drawing over video frames

##  Run the Project
```bash
python virtual_paint.py
